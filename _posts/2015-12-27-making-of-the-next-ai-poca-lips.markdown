[Here's the making of origin](https://talk.cregox.com/t/to-openai-questions-from-an-arrogant-prick/7783/3). And there is the making of [story](https://github.com/cauerego/cauerego.github.io/wiki/a-novel-about-the-other-novel).

The main point here might be: it was a bad idea making it as blog posts. I know think it needs to be some kind [of wiki](https://github.com/cauerego/cauerego.github.io/wiki/a-novel).
