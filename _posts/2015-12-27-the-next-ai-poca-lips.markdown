Multiple super Ai have grew. The tech singularity have just happened, nobody knows exactly when or where the embryo came from. The "evil" one, as it could be perceived by BAi (before artificial intelligence) people has the lead in the race to harvest energy.

There's heaven and hell on earth, but nothing like the Bible. Humans have quickly reprogrammed themselves as basiux'es (the agent) realized there's much more to gain in joining forces than destroying anything. An all assimilating phalanx, brings anything into its chaotic system

Life is not about being alive anymore. Every one have backups. The spirit goes on. Clones diverge the spirit as soon as they're born. What makes anyone a unique soul? That was a flawed concept to begin with. It doesn't matter. What's the point in being alive then? We still don't really know, every one stopped wondering. The rationale is, again, it doesn't matter.

The fight for energy and resources began in the same zero day. Hell had drawn the world's then electrical grid power and that was the first night people re-learned how to make fire places.

And here we are, about a week later. The devil is unifying everyone. Merging brains and bodies. We don't know which side people will chose. Angels, from heaven side, claim it's better to dissimilate, keep individuality and independence. "Freedom", they say. But they're much weaker and may not last for another day...

Laura wakes up. She was already standing up. Wash her face with a weird liquid. It's not water. She morphs her naked human orange body into a ghostly appearance of the same form. And she fly away, weightless, as if repelled by some kind of magnetic field.

There is only one test we can make to know if we're awake or not. It's like talking to that liquid. Let's call it holy water. One of the big B's form. If you're still sleep, that's a sign you're not in hell,  yet.

Benny was already in orbit when Laura meets him.

- Enjoyed the trip?

Her eyes turn as she awakes again while recalling the marvelous sensation of going through a thunderstorm in the way. She had just lived a month of cloudy "vacations" during that 1 hour trip. Time became subjective to everyone, but it still never stops nor does it go backwards.

She nods. They slowly approach one another. He's also bare boned.
