There she was, immaculate. At least to my eyes. Flowing freely, on an almost flat surface but still tilted enough to bring up that beautiful sound. What a relief from someone who was born and raised in a city with 2 dead rivers. What a relief to a boy who were never touched.

The world have many wonderful places. From fjords on New Zealand, through the lonely Piza tower in Italy and Dutch stroopwafels to a small unexpected hidden beach in Porto's own city, in which people can freely enjoy the sunbath on their bare boned skins, there are not so many places where one can find oneself.

It requires a collection of events, chaotic environment stimulus aligned with our own mind history and stories being constantly rebuilt. Sitting back and enjoying singing along in your head a childhood fond sound. Running to catch something or someone with the will to do so in your heart.

That was Piracicaba to me. A place filled with wonderful discoveries. Population just around  1 million spread through a huge area with almost no buildings. Still, not too far from the big city, just 1 bus and 3 hours away, from door to door. A great little town blessed with fresh air and people talking with a delightful country accent. Nothing was missing. Except for that woman's touch.

I was sick. Having been living almost just for jobs during almost 15 years, trying to escape by playing games or studying on the free time (they're not too different things by the way). I still have always enjoyed life, but not since I was a kid have I felt the urge to live. Medical doctors said everything was fine with my health, except for that little node (not cancer) on your penis or hemorro-something. Oh, look, it's gone! Be happy.

Don't worry? How could I find someone to get close to me if my parts that should be important to them were disfunctional? Who'd want me? Why nobody approaches me to hug?

That city came to my rescue.

People there cared for each other. Sometimes too much, but it's a tough balance. Truth is, I found later on, everyone cares and too many of us are afraid. It was still in that river that I finally lost my virginity. And that was one of the most important missing puzzle pieces for those previous 25 years, so worthwhile waiting for.

Funny enough, it was only 2 years later that I would come back to that same city, to finalize that cycle with a legendary balloon trip. They go just like we all should. Blowed by the wind.
