yeah, I've done it yet [once again](/2015/12/25/new-blog-platform-once-again.html)! O_o

I'll try to keep this one for general experimentations and the forever-on-hiatus [bdd novel](https://github.com/cauerego/cauerego.github.io#bdd-novel). for instance, [soon](https://github.com/cauerego/cauerego.github.io/issues/7) you should be able to add comments! :)

[the new one](https://medium.cregox.com) should now be my main new generation "[blog](https://cregox.com/blog)".

and [the now-old-current one, made in discourse](https://talk.cregox.com/c/blog), will either soon migrate to some free platform for talking or just be kept as a static archived reference along with the rest of its host.

oh, and if you're wondering about my lack of "proper text formatting", it's [a very old attempt](https://medium.com/cregox/esperanca-ultima-e90ebcf86733#.xsl3j7kop) to actually improve writing and reading. right now I just mostly prefer saving uppercase letters for some names and as a raising voice indication, rather than emphasis on periods. I also still use it for "i" for some reason, and for pages I don't want to explain myself but keep a classical look.

anyway, for today that's enough announcements. been working on this for the past 2 days, my "week"ends, as my current job is 4x2.
