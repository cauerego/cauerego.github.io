TK ![green and blue creation](/image/teal-crayon.jpg)

and then there was light! and darkness… oops, light again, but a teal colour. what the actual fuck?

(try picturing every scene transition as a cut-less flow. and a crayon everywhere a crayon could be.)

a teal crayon.

TK
it is removed from the pack, by this One kid.
she draws two circles.
the sun shines over the earth.
yellow crayon.
a spiderman drawing in an old computer. smooth. and superman, pixelated, seen, now, in a new computer.
the now grown up One kid is playing world of warcraft. a computer game, played online by thousands of people at the same time, fighting mostly against computer medieval magical monsters.
beside another virgin grown up. both silently.
the power goes off. all is dark. someone screams an uptight "shit". there's silence. and laughter.
the laugh turns into a hospital siren.
red crayon.
surgeries are taking place in One. in the eyes. a simple genital cosmetic. something on a butt.
a fart. turns into shit. garbage. compost. a common recycling cycle in an ecovillage.
a baby is born. and another one.
pink and blue crayons.
a couple having sex. One's on top. they're both fully enjoying it. however he cums outside. she's relieved. he's exhausted. or was it the other way around? TK
they dress up and go together into an office. before they can sit in chairs far apart, suddenly, it is now a beautiful agroforestry (syntropic permaculture). and they're breaking apart, moving away from each other, sadly, crying. then, an intense hugging and kissing. 
cyan crayon.
the ocean. a sea front view. beautiful balcony. simple apartment. a calm paved street on the front. an annoying night street light. light pollution on the sky.
cars. driving back and forth to work. just a 30 minutes commute through nice green spaces mixed with small towns. a bit tiring. a bit refreshing. no biggies.
friends playing games in the apartment. with the couple. and kids together. none are theirs.
green crayon.
One is in the agroforestry. it turns into monoculture. some beautiful snakes around. and spiders. a few mosquitos. rats. wild boars. yes, tamera.
dancing alone. some people join. so much love, but too much distance. contact dancing. slow and a lot of contact. it ends very quickly. a balloon in the sky. a new person, from outside, just join in. they sit together on the sunset. play fight. and kiss on the ground.
One is now meeting someone from the contact dance. they sleep together in a tent. and have sex. side by side. it was clearly attempted before, but this time penetration worked. then, the next morning it's good bye.
driving with 2 new friends. one sleeping in the back. two laughing in the front.
leaves then behind, they'll be hitchhiking now. fun moments.
grey crayon.
someone's driving. alone. for a long time. in the city. in the mountains. traveling. going to work. basically no laughing. sometimes practicing singing.
one note turns into orgastic moaning. now in a bed. two more attractive people, dressed in black, are doing tantra massage to One (who always looks very different, a different person even, but clearly the same soul). it's no big deal, but there is some learning of new techniques that increasingly improve the sex performance, such as the moaning.
the Other One is outside of the room. working. trying to ignore One's sexual activities.




TK world needs harmony, even if all each one of us need is love. and what balance means, yin yang? reality needs it? dunbar number, big numbers, randomness etc.
