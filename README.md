# [cregox blog](http://blog.cregox.com)

Made with [Tinypress](https://tinypress.co/), to use a better blogging technology, easier to customize to be prettier and slimmer...

But it's still [missing some important features](https://github.com/tinypressco/tinypressco.github.io/issues/created_by/cauerego), such as social buttons (just for marketing) or easy forums integration (I would probably start with muut, right now). Disqus / commenting is just not engaging enough and creating a sense of community is at the core of blogging, imho. :)

So, this was to be my next blog... Then, on the 2nd post, I've suddenly started writing the novel. Finally, after considering making it into a deticated "creating the novel channel" I figured "nah, it will still be cregox's blogging channel, and the novel is a just one subset of it". If a community is to ever be built around it, they'll figure out how to move from there later on.
